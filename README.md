7 There must be a form element meeting the following requirements: (5 pts each × 8 items = 40 pts)

c There must be a single line text box whose value is associated with the name “carrot”.
d There must be a series of three checkboxes. They should be labeled “Pizza”, “Tacos”, and “Burgers”,
and submit those values under the name “food”.
e There must be a group of three radio buttons labeled “X”, “Y”, and “Z”. They should submit a
value that matches their label and the server should be able to access it under the name “xyz”.
f The “Z” radio button should start off in a checked state.
g There must be a field in your form that is not displayed in the browser, but which contains your
zid as a value and submits it under the name “zid”.
h The submit button must have a caption of “Carpe diem”.
What to turn in?
Submit, through Blackboard, the following:
▶ The HTML file. Name it z1234567.html but with your zid instead. Blackboard will not accept
HTML files, so you will have to compress the .html into a .zip to submit.
▶ A link to that same HTML file, hosted on our webserver. Place it in your public_html directory and
provide the appropriate link in the comments of your submission.
DO NOT DELETE THE HTML FILE FROM THE SERVER UNTIL AFTER YOUR ASSIGNMENT
HAS BEEN GRADED. IF IT IS MISSING WHEN THE TA CHECKS FOR IT, YOU
WILL RECEIVE A ZERO.
